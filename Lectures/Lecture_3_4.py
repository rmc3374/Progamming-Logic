# 4 specific situations to loop data:
    # Filtering (i.e. looking for only even or odd numbers) - built into most programming languages
    # Sort - bubble sorts, fifo sorts, first in/first out, etc.
    # Serching - wanting to find something
    # exceptions
# loops inherantly not performant (not efficient)
# dual-while loop executes code before code asks if it should continue
    # some loops execute without having to make decision
# loop control variable = sentinel variable/sentinel loop variable
    # variable happens before loop entered, is tested in loop, body of loop alters value
# definite loops = happens for predetermined # of times (never used)
# counter-controlled/counted loop - counts # of loops
# indefinite loops - executes forever if user doesn't have control
# for statement/for loop - definite loop
# do-while/until: do does work before while executes
# GIGO: garbage in, garbage out -
